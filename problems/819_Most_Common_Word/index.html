    <h1>LeetCode 819. Most Common Word</h1>
    <div class="elfjS" data-track-load="description_content">
      <p>
        Given a string <code>paragraph</code> and a string array of the banned
        words <code>banned</code>, return
        <em>the most frequent word that is not banned</em>. It is
        <strong>guaranteed</strong> there is
        <strong>at least one word</strong> that is not banned, and that the
        answer is <strong>unique</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The words in <code>paragraph</code> are
        <strong>case-insensitive</strong> and the answer should be returned in
        <strong>lowercase</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong> that words can not contain punctuation symbols.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

      <pre><strong>Input:</strong> paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.", banned = ["hit"]
<strong>Output:</strong> <span id="ex1" style="color: red; font-size: large"></span> ; Expected
          -> "ball"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
</pre>

      <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

      <pre><strong>Input:</strong> paragraph = "a.", banned = []
<strong>Output:</strong> <span id="ex2" style="color: red; font-size: large"></span> ; Expected
          -> "a"
</pre>

      <p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

      <pre><strong>Input:</strong> paragraph = "abc abc? abcd the jeff!", banned = ["abc","abcd","jeff"]
<strong>Output:</strong> <span id="ex3" style="color: red; font-size: large"></span> ; Expected
          -> "the"
</pre>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>1 &lt;= paragraph.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
        <li>
          paragraph consists of English letters, space <code>' '</code>, or one
          of the symbols: <code>"!?',;."</code>.
        </li>
        <li><code>0 &lt;= banned.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
        <li><code>1 &lt;= banned[i].length &lt;= 10</code></li>
        <li>
          <code>banned[i]</code> consists of only lowercase English letters.
        </li>
