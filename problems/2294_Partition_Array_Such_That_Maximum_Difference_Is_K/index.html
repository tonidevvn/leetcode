      <p>
        You are given an integer array <code>nums</code> and an integer
        <code>k</code>. You may partition <code>nums</code> into one or more
        <strong>subsequences</strong> such that each element in
        <code>nums</code> appears in <strong>exactly</strong> one of the
        subsequences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Return
        <em
          >the <strong>minimum </strong>number of subsequences needed such that
          the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each
          subsequence is <strong>at most</strong> </em
        ><code>k</code><em>.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        A <strong>subsequence</strong> is a sequence that can be derived from
        another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the
        order of the remaining elements.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

      <pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,6,1,2,5], k = 2
      <strong>Output:</strong> <span id="ex1" style="color: red; font-size: large"></span> ; Expected -> 2
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>
      We can partition nums into the two subsequences [3,1,2] and [6,5].
      The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequence is 3 - 1 = 2.
      The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequence is 6 - 5 = 1.
      Since two subsequences were created, we return 2. It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of subsequences needed.
      </pre>

      <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

      <pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3], k = 1
      <strong>Output:</strong> <span id="ex2" style="color: red; font-size: large"></span> ; Expected -> 2
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>
      We can partition nums into the two subsequences [1,2] and [3].
      The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequence is 2 - 1 = 1.
      The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequence is 3 - 3 = 0.
      Since two subsequences were created, we return 2. Note that another optimal solution is to partition nums into the two subsequences [1] and [2,3].
      </pre>

      <p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

      <pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,2,4,5], k = 0
      <strong>Output:</strong> <span id="ex3" style="color: red; font-size: large"></span> ; Expected -> 3
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>
      We can partition nums into the three subsequences [2,2], [4], and [5].
      The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequences is 2 - 2 = 0.
      The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequences is 4 - 4 = 0.
      The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the third subsequences is 5 - 5 = 0.
      Since three subsequences were created, we return 3. It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of subsequences needed.
      </pre>

      <p><strong class="example">Example 4:</strong></p>

      <pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [5,16,3,20,9,20,16,19,6], k = 4
      <strong>Output:</strong> <span id="ex4" style="color: red; font-size: large"></span> ; Expected -> 3
